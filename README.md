# Heart Disease Predictor Web App

This project was done using the Heart Disease Data Set from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. A logistic regression model was trained to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease. The trained model was used to create a web application that allows a user to input feature values and receive a prediction as output. The web application is deployed on a Heroku server and can be found at https://predict-heart-disease.herokuapp.com/
